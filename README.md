Briefing: This is a very specific case of agriculture. When it rains, some farms are unable to receive mechanized operations, in addition to posing risks to employees and the profitability of the business. Therefore, based on some variables such as humidity, rain from previous days, probability of rain for the current day and the following day, terrain slope and type of operation, an algorithm was trained that allows 4 recommendations for these situations. This project was carried out with AWS products, more precisely the Sagemaker, which enables a jupyter notebook where you can use the python language for programming. As I cannot expose details that identify the customer, here are other things I can show.

Codes: Code for training the multiclass_classifier type algorithm in instance ml.m4.xlarge, with number of training classes = 4 (four labels).

Note: Some parts of the code need to be removed so as not to identify the customer. :(
